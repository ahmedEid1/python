## Chapter 1
- Scaler Types :
    - int
      - unlimited precision signed integers
    - float
      - `float("nan"), float("inf"), float("-inf")`
    - None
      - null value
    - bool
        - `True` or `False`
            - `0, [], ''` is falsy

- Zen :
  - **_Flat is better than nested_**
  - _**explict is better than implicit**_   
----
- `input()` : request input text from the user
-----
## Chapter -1
- what is a resource ?
    - program element that must be released or closed after use
    - python mange resources using context managers
---
- `open(file, [mode], [encoding])` : open a file for reading or writing 
-----
- getting the default encoding of a system :
    - `import sys`
    - `sys.getdefaultencoding()`
-----
- opening files modes :
    - w, r, a
    - selector : 
        - b, t
----
- `write()`:
    - return the number of codePoints written to the file
-  `open()` :
    - return a file-like object
    
-  `read([num])`:
    - **without args** : return all the content of the file in the first call then '' ''
    - **in text mode**: takes number of char to read
    - **in byte mode**: takes number of bytes to read

- `seek()` : used to move the courser
    - can only be moved to `0` or values form` tell()`
    
- `readLine()` : read the line by line on every call
- `readLines()` : return a list of all the lines in the file
-----
- python has `writeLines` but not `writeline` !
- `writeLines` :
    - takes a list of string to add to the file
        - note : you must add the ` \n` yourself to start a new line
----
- **the file object is iterable, so you can loop over it line by line**
----
- how to print without adding a new line between every two print statement ?
    - you can use `sys.stdout.write()`
---
- to ensure the file get close :
    - put the `open` in a `try` and the `close` in the `finally`
        - or use a with-block
----
##### with-block
- control flow structure for managing resources
    - can be used with any object that support the context-manager protocol
------------------------
- bitwise operations :
    - `&` (bitwise and)
    - `|` (bitwise or)
    - `>>` (right-shift)
    - `<<` (left-shift)
---------
- to wrap your object with a context manager :
    - `from contextlib import closing`
    - wrap the constructor with the method :
        - `with closing(myObject()) as obj`
